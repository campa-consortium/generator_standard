# Overview

This repository is an effort to standardize the interface of the **generators** in optimization libraries such as [`Xopt`](https://github.com/ChristopherMayes/Xopt), [`optimas`](https://github.com/optimas-org/optimas), [`libEnsemble`](https://github.com/Libensemble/libensemble), [`rsopt`](https://github.com/radiasoft/rsopt).

The objective of this effort is for these different libraries to be able to use each other's generators with little effort.

*Example: [using `Xopt` generators in `optimas`](https://github.com/optimas-org/optimas/pull/151)*
