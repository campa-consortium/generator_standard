# Overview

This repository is an effort to standardize the interface of the **generators** in optimization libraries such as [`Xopt`](https://github.com/ChristopherMayes/Xopt), [`optimas`](https://github.com/optimas-org/optimas), [`libEnsemble`](https://github.com/Libensemble/libensemble), [`rsopt`](https://github.com/radiasoft/rsopt).

**The objective of this effort is for these different libraries to be able to use each other's generators with little effort.**

*Example: [using `Xopt` generators in `optimas`](https://github.com/optimas-org/optimas/pull/151)*

# Definitions

- **Generator:**

  A generator is an object that recommends points to be evaluated in an optimization. It can also receive data (evaluations from past or on-going optimization), which helps it make more informed recommendations.

  *Note:* The generator does **not** orchestrate the overall optimization (e.g. dispatch evaluations, etc.). As such, it is distinct from `libEnsemble`'s `gen_f` function.

  *Examples:
    - `Xopt`: [here](https://github.com/ChristopherMayes/Xopt/blob/main/xopt/generators/scipy/neldermead.py#L64) is the generator for the Nelder-Mead method. All Xopt generators implement the methods `generate` (i.e. make recommendations) and `add_data` (i.e. receive data).
    - `optimas`: [here](https://github.com/optimas-org/optimas/blob/main/optimas/generators/base.py#L27) is the base class for all generators. It implements the methods `ask` (i.e. make recommendations) and `tell` (i.e. receive data).

# Standardization

Each type of generator (e.g., Nelder-Nead, different flavors of GA, BO, etc.) will be a Python class that defines the following methods:

- **Constructor:**

  The constructor will include variable positional and keyword arguments to
  accommodate the different options that each type of generator has.

- `ask()`:

  Returns set of points in the input space, to be evaluated next.
  *TBD: how many points? Which (array) format for the returned data?*


- `tell( X )`:

  Feeds data (past evaluations) to the generator
  *TBD: which (array) format for X?*
